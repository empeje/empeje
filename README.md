**I'm on the mission to inspire and groom people everywhere so that they can improve their lives, raise the bar, and contribute back to society.**

For that mission, I'm currently building a company called [Kulkul Technology][KULKUL] where we develop software with clients all over the world and create a community to groom the next generation of software engineers. [Join our upcoming event here!][MEETUP]
